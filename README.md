Game idea to use reinforcement learning to train little armies to battle each other on a grid space battlefield.

2 reasons for the project:
1. Wanted a "playground" to continue to working on reinforcement learning.
2. Wanted a reason to work through more of the practical implications of the SOLID and GRASP software design principles.

Project still in infancy stages.
