# King

*Project still in infancy stages.*

Game idea to use reinforcement learning to train little armies to battle each other on a grid space battlefield.

2 reasons for the project:
1. Wanted a "playground" to continue to working on reinforcement learning.
2. Wanted a reason to work through more of the practical implications of the SOLID and GRASP software design principles.



### Project Layout
- /battle - classes and modules for creating and running a battle
- /engines - modules for creating and managing the machine learning algorithms that decide character actions
- /models - 'domain object' class definitions
- /repositories - data access modules
- /ui - modules for UI and UX
- /util - utility modules
- /logging - modules for both capturing battle turn data and system logging
